            Armenia Tours
            Armenia is a mountainous nation in West Asia, a former Soviet Republic, and was one of the first 
            Christian nations, embracing Christianity in the fourth century. This rich cultural and natural 
            environment makes it an exciting destination for a wide range of adventure, activity and walking holidays.<br><br>
            There are many pagan sites to visit as well as UNESCO World Heritage-listed churches, which are  
            almost without exception built in stunning locations. Surrounded by forests, perched on the top of dramatic gorges or 
            silhouetted before snow-capped mountains, they draw us to magnificent open spaces filled with a huge variety of trees and wild flowers. 
            On Armenia tours we see wonderful mountains, lakes and waterfalls in the countryside and relish cooling breezes while the cafes and 
            restaurants of the country's capital, Yerevan, are proof of an emerging economy. Mount Ararat towers majestically over the city, 
            and beautiful scenery is plentiful.
